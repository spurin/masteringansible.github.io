Video DescriptionExploit the power of Ansible to expedite scalable orchestration, DevOps, and automation About This VideoSuitable for users of all major operating systems (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux). Explore Ansible with cloud services and its AWS provisioning. Troubleshoot Ansible and its supported resources and utilities. In DetailAnsible is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs. Designed for multi-tier deployments since day one, Ansible models your IT infrastructure by describing how all of your systems inter-relate, rather than just managing one system at a time. This professional video course on Ansible guides the user through a multitude of topics in order to understand and professionally master Ansible. It aims to help you master Ansible while tackling and learning multiple topics. It starts with Ansible’s architecture and how to provide effective scalable automation. Then we move on to installing and configuring it with various platforms. Further, we look into Ansible modules and playbooks with YAML syntax and execute it. Next you will get to know about advanced Ansible playbooks, and even structure them. You will learn to use Ansible with cloud services and containers and provision it with AWS and Docker. Finally, you will master troubleshooting, validating, and testing with Ansible.

Naturally, when a system is started it’s almost like a motor reflex action, to ping google.com :) Whilst this would normally work, in the lab setup, the dedicated dnsmasq virtual machine acts as a DNS server for the rest of the lab environment. It provides internal DNS resolution for each of the nodes and DNS forwarding, for all other nodes in the lab. If you’re experiencing issues with DNS resolution, check that the dnsmasq virtual machine is running, that it’s IP address 192.168.0.40 is contactable, and from the dnsmasq guest, that internet connectivity is available. Should you have DNS issues outside of this, please leave a comment below or contact me via the social media links provided.","categories":[],"tags":[],"author":"James Spurin"},{"title":"Virtual Machine Download","slug":"Virtual-Machine-Download","date":"2019-03-10T15:47:56.000Z","updated":"2019-03-10T16:01:18.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/03/10/Virtual-Machine-Download/","link":"","permalink":"http://masteringansible.com/2019/03/10/Virtual-Machine-Download/","excerpt":"","text":"The virtual machines used for the lab in the course, can be downloaded using the following shortened url - https://goo.gl/b68auU I’ve been contacted in the past and advised that this url has failed individuals, upon checking I’ve not seen any issues but thats not to say there wasn’t an intermittent failure.
