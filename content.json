Video DescriptionExploit the power of Ansible to expedite scalable orchestration, DevOps, and automation About This VideoSuitable for users of all major operating systems (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux). Explore Ansible with cloud services and its AWS provisioning. Troubleshoot Ansible and its supported resources and utilities. In DetailAnsible is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs. Designed for multi-tier deployments since day one, Ansible models your IT infrastructure by describing how all of your systems inter-relate, rather than just managing one system at a time. This professional video course on Ansible guides the user through a multitude of topics in order to understand and professionally master Ansible. It aims to help you master Ansible while tackling and learning multiple topics. It starts with Ansible’s architecture and how to provide effective scalable automation. Then we move on to installing and configuring it with various platforms. Further, we look into Ansible modules and playbooks with YAML syntax and execute it. Next you will get to know about advanced Ansible playbooks, and even structure them. You will learn to use Ansible with cloud services and containers and provision it with AWS and Docker. Finally, you will master troubleshooting, validating, and testing with Ansible.

It is recommended that you leverage the provided control host for the best experience, however, this post gives some guidance on aspects that need to be considered to see the best from the course, should you decide to create your own. Assumed user of packt for Section 02. Ansible Architecture and Design, 01. Ansible InventoriesIn some of the examples used, the playbooks provided in the repo for both the centos and ubuntu hosts directly - 123456789[centos]centos1centos2centos3[ubuntu]ubuntu1ubuntu2ubuntu3 In the initial sections of Architecture and Design, Ansible Inventories, if you were running this from the supplied control host (ubuntu-c), the user you’d be connecting from would by default be the packt user. Subsequently, the packt user, exists on all of the target lab hosts. The local user of your own control host is likely to be different and as a result, you’d experience issues with connectivity. To mitigate, make the following changes to playbooks, adding ansible_user=packt - 123456789[centos]centos1 ansible_user=packtcentos2 ansible_user=packtcentos3 ansible_user=packt[ubuntu]ubuntu1 ansible_user=packtubuntu2 ansible_user=packtubuntu3 ansible_user=packt Whilst this can be achieved in a more convenient fashion using vars, this isn’t covered until a later section, hence the approach above is recommended for consistency until familiarity with the different approaches is achieved. When progressing through the course, should the hosts file contain a connectivity that assumes a non root user, update the file either directly as above, or via a hosts var directive, i.e. 12[ubuntu:vars]ansible_user=packt Thanks to Andrew Graham (queglay) for highlighting this issue at https://github.com/spurin/masteringansible/issues/9 DNS IssuesThe control host supplied with the virtual machine is configured to resolve it’s DNS, from the supplied machine, dnsmasq. There’s a few ways of resolving this. A quick fix, is to set your DNS server temporarily, to that of the dnsmasq resolver at 192.168.0.40, it acts as a generic forwarder for other internet connectivity so shouldn’t affect your online experience, whilst the VM is running. Alternatively, if you’re familiar with editing hosts files, you can add entries accordingly on your control host as per the IP details provided in the lab slides. When doing so, add both the hostname and hostname.masteringansible.com entries for each. Again, thanks to Andrew Graham (queglay) for highlighting this issue at https://github.com/spurin/masteringansible/issues/8 Nginx playbookThe nginx playbook template was mapped against the nginx configuration of that available on the associated lab instances, i.e. centosx and ubuntux. The default nginx configuration across the multitude of linux flavours will vary and as a result, this exercise may or may not work effectively in your own environment outside of the lab. I suggest for this, either use the lab, or work on changing the templates to meet your local configuration, it shouldn’t be too difficult. If you do succeed, let me know in the comments and reference your updated templates.

I believe some users have seen this and have thought of it as a requirement prior to continuing. If you wish to, you can update the lab environment to the latest version of Ubuntu, however it is not a requirement and some of the playbooks that template the likes of nginx configuration may not work, if there’s been an upstream change to the base configuration. Given that the lab has been designed to match the context of the course, I advise that you don’t upgrade the environment, unless you’re happy to address subsequent changes that may arise to the course content.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Virtual Machine","slug":"Virtual-Machine","permalink":"http://masteringansible.com/tags/Virtual-Machine/"},{"name":"motd","slug":"motd","permalink":"http://masteringansible.com/tags/motd/"}],"author":"James Spurin"},{"title":"DNS Issues with Lab Virtual Machines","slug":"DNS-Issues-with-Lab-Virtual-Machines","date":"2019-03-13T21:59:00.000Z","updated":"2019-03-14T17:44:17.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/03/13/DNS-Issues-with-Lab-Virtual-Machines/","link":"","permalink":"http://masteringansible.com/2019/03/13/DNS-Issues-with-Lab-Virtual-Machines/","excerpt":"","text":"An issue that I’ve been contacted about on the course, is a lack of internet connectivity within the guests of the VM lab.

It provides internal DNS resolution for each of the nodes and DNS forwarding, for all other nodes in the lab. If you’re experiencing issues with DNS resolution, check that the dnsmasq virtual machine is running, that it’s IP address 192.168.0.40 is contactable, and from the dnsmasq guest, that internet connectivity is available.
